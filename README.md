# D3_GlobalMap

##**Project Overview**
This project aims to create an interactive global map using D3.js and React. The map will visualize geographical data and provide rich interactivity features, such as zooming, panning, and clustering markers for various cities and assets. The project will also handle overlapping marker labels and adapt to different zoom levels, ensuring a clear and informative visualization at every scale.

##**Features**
**Global Map Visualization: **Interactive map based on D3.js with a focus on displaying geographical data.
**Zoom & Pan:** Seamless zooming and panning functionalities, dynamically adjusting the view and labels.
**Marker Clustering:** Cluster cities and assets when zoomed out, and dynamically reveal individual markers when zoomed in.
**Label Management:** Efficient label placement to avoid overlap and maintain readability.
**Responsive Design:** Adaptable to different screen sizes and resolutions.
**Dynamic Tooltip:** Display additional information on hover, including custom data from the grid structure.
Technologies Used
**React:** For building the UI components and managing the application's state.
**D3.js:** For rendering and manipulating the map and its elements.
**JavaScript (ES6):** Core programming language.
**SVG:** Scalable Vector Graphics for rendering the map and its features.

##**How to Install**

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/D3_GlobalMap.git
cd D3_GlobalMap
Install dependencies:

npm install
Start the development server:

npm start
Usage
Once the project is running, you will see the global map displayed. You can zoom in, pan around, and interact with markers representing cities and assets. Hovering over markers will show detailed tooltips, and clicking on clusters will reveal more data as you zoom in.

##**Future Improvements**
Add more layers to the map (e.g., political boundaries, terrain, etc.).
Improve performance for large datasets.
Enhance marker customization and clustering algorithms.
Implement additional data filters based on user input.
